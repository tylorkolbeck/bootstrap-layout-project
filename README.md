# Bootstrap Layout Project

## The problem

Build a responsive portfolio layout using the bootstrap framework. 

## Requirements
* Responsive to all screen sizes
* Utilize the Bootstrap framework
* Contains a Navbar component
* Contains a Footer component
* Utilizes responsive images
* Minimize use of media queries
* Deployed to GitHub pages
* Use semantic html

## What I learned

### 1. Break the project down
Break the project down into smaller components first.  Work on those smaller components and then bring them all together to produce the final layout.

### 2. Use Bootstrap grid system
How to achieve a desired layout using Bootstrap predefined grid system classes. 

### 3. Bootstrap is not original
There are many predefined bootstrap components but they need to be customized so that your final product does not feel like every bootstraped project. But working with bootstrap is similiar to working with a company's style framework.

### 4. Deploying to GitHub
Github offers a service to deploy static HTML pages to github pages.  This service is not meant for deployment but more for testing. The page is far from real time so do not rely on that.
